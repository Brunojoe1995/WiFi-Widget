- Enabled the prefix length display for all IP addresses, alongside additional sub properties (SiteLocal, LinkLocal, Multicast, Loopback)
- Added an in-app WiFi Status display
- Added an in-app display of all current WiFi properties, with copy-to-clipboard functionality on click
- Decoupled static and dynamic widget themes, meaning that you can now select whether to use either the one or the other

[Changes]
- UI improvements all over the place (as per usual), including the removal of spring animations, which weren't necessarily adding to the apps UX smoothness
- Replaced most humdrum toasts by crispy snackbars, featuring icons and actions
- New default custom widget colors
