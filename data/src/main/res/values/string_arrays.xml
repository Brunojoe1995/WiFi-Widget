    <string-array name="ipv4">
        <item>Internet Protocol Address, serving the two main purposes of identifying the network interface of your device and providing it\'s location within the network, thereby making it addressable. The IPv4 representation corresponds to a 32-bit number. The displayed address is your internal one, meaning that it\'s only visible from within your network.</item>

        <item>Internet Protocol Address, serving the two main purposes of identifying the network interface of your device and providing it\'s location within the network, thereby making it addressable. The IPv6 representation corresponds to a 128-bit number. This is the local IPv6 address, meaning that it\'s only visible from within your network.</item>

        <item>Internet Protocol Address, serving the two main purposes of identifying the network interface of your device and providing it\'s location within the network, thereby making it addressable. The IPv6 representation corresponds to a 128-bit number. This is one of the two public IPv6 addresses, Android devices are typically assigned with. Of those two addresses, one comes from the Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) mechanism - meaning that it will always be the same - whereas the other one is a privacy variant, that changes every few hours.</item>

    <string-array name="frequency">
        <item>The radio frequency band employed for WiFi signal transmission, following the IEEE 802.11 technical standards. Bands for use in WiFi communication provided by IEEE 802.11 lie at 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 3.6 GHz, 4.9 GHz, 5 GHz, 5.9 GHz, 6 GHz and 60 GHz. Bands are divided into several distinct channels.</item>

    <string-array name="channel">
        <item>The sub frequencies which the main frequency bands are divided into, and via which WiFi communication takes place. As per the IEEE 802.11 standard, channels are numbered at 5 MHz spacing within a band (except in the 60 GHz band, where they are 2.16 GHz apart), where the number corresponds to the centre frequency of the channel. Although channels are numbered at 5 MHz spacing, transmitters generally occupy at least 20 MHz, and standards allow for channels to be bonded together to form wider channels for faster throughput.</item>
