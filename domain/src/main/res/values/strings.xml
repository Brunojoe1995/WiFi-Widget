    <string name="ssid_description">Service Set Identifier. Your networks name.</string>
    <string name="bssid_description">Basic Service Set Identifier. A 48-bit label abiding by MAC-48 conventions which identifies your devices basic service set.</string>
    <string name="ipv4_description">Internet Protocol Address, serving the two main purposes of identifying the network interface of your device and providing its location within the network, thereby making it addressable. The IPv4 representation corresponds to a 32-bit number. The displayed address is your internal one, meaning that it\'s only visible from within your network.</string>
    <string name="ipv6_description">Internet Protocol Address, serving the two main purposes of identifying the network interface of your device and providing its location within the network, thereby making it addressable. The IPv6 representation corresponds to a 128-bit number.</string>
    <string name="frequency_description">The radio frequency band employed for WiFi signal transmission, following the IEEE 802.11 technical standards. Bands for use in WiFi communication provided by IEEE 802.11 lie at 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 3.6 GHz, 4.9 GHz, 5 GHz, 5.9 GHz, 6 GHz and 60 GHz. Bands are divided into several distinct channels.</string>
    <string name="channel_description">The sub frequencies which the main frequency bands are divided into, and via which WiFi communication takes place. As per the IEEE 802.11 standard, channels are numbered at 5 MHz spacing within a band (except in the 60 GHz band, where they are 2.16 GHz apart), where the number corresponds to the center frequency of the channel. Although channels are numbered at 5 MHz spacing, transmitters generally occupy at least 20 MHz, and standards allow for channels to be bonded together to form wider channels for faster throughput.</string>
    <string name="link_speed_description">The theoretical data transmission max speed between your device and the router.</string>
    <string name="gateway_description">A Gateway is a device uniting the functionality of a modem, i.e., communicating with your ISP (Internet Service Provider), and a router, i.e., translating the data received by the modem and distributing it as WiFi signal to the client devices being present in the network.</string>
    <string name="dns_description">Domain Name System. Associates domain names with various types of information, acting as a database. Most notably, it translates domain names to their underlying IP addresses, needed for locating and communicating with them.</string>
    <string name="dhcp_description">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. A service which automatically assigns IP addresses and other network parameters to devices connected to a network.</string>
    <string name="include_local">Include local</string>
    <string name="include_public">Include public</string>
    <string name="prefix_length_description">A network prefix length, often referred to as a subnet mask or subnet prefix length, is a numerical value that defines the size of a subnet within an IP address range. IP addresses are divided into two parts: the network portion and the host portion. The network prefix length determines how many bits in the IP address are used for the network part.\n\nFor example, in the IPv4 address \"192.168.1.1,\" if the network prefix length is 24, it means the first 24 bits are used to identify the network, and the remaining 8 bits are available for host addresses within that network. This allows for the subdivision of IP address space into smaller manageable segments called subnets, enabling efficient management and routing of network traffic.</string>
